# OS-Lab Course Practices's Solutions

This repository contains the practice exercises and projects from the OS-Lab course I am taking during the winter and spring semesters of 2024. The course focused on introducing C# and the .NET Framework, and using these technologies to explore operating system concepts, process management, and event handling on the Windows operating system and more.

## Introduction
The OS-Lab course was designed to provide hands-on experience with operating system principles and concepts, using C# and the .NET Framework as the primary tools. Throughout the course, we dived into various aspects of operating systems, including process management, synchronization, and event handling, by implementing practical applications and exploring the Windows operating system.

## Technologies Used
- **Windows Operating System**: The target platform for the course practices, leveraging the operating system's features and functionality.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the course practices and projects.
- **Microsoft .NET Framework**: The software framework used for building and running the C# applications.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing, compiling, and debugging the C# code.
- [**C# Dev Kit extension for Visual Studio Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit): The extension used to provide C# language support and project management features in Visual Studio Code.


## Course Topics So far
The OS-Lab course covered the following topics:
1. Introduction to C# and the .NET Framework
2. Process management in Windows
3. Event handling and asynchronous programming
4. Working with files using dotent on windows

## Project Descriptions
In each practice's directory there is a "practice description.md" file that explains the goal of the practice.
Throughout the course, we complete several practices that apply the concepts learned in the lectures. Here are brief descriptions of some of the key projects so far:

1. **Process Monitoring and Control**: Developed a C# application that can monitor and control running processes on a Windows system, including the ability to start, stop, and view process information.
2. **Event-driven Application**: Built an application that showcases various event handling techniques, such as mouse events, keyboard events, and custom events.
3. **File Reading and Saving**: Built an application that utilizes file management capabilities of dotnet framework.

## How to Run the Projects
To run the projects in this repository, you'll need to have the following software installed:
- Windows Operating System
- .NET Framework 8.0 (or a compatible version)

Once you have the required software, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Check the .csproj in the project(s) you're interested in for required nuget packages and install them
3. Run the individual project(s) you're interested in.

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or contribute to the repository. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
